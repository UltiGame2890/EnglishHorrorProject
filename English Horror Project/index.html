          <p>There existed an old man who the narrator didn't hate. The old man didn't do any harm to the narrator, however the narrator claims that the old man has the eye of a vulture, which is "out for him" and stares into his soul. The narrator has a desire to kill the old man, and devises a plan to get rid of the old man, and thus his eye.

                  <h3>Conflict</h3>
                  <p>There are technically two conflicts to the story: Person vs Person and Person vs Self. Person vs. Person: The narrator has a hatred toward the old man's eye and he tries killing the old man and smothers him to death. Person vs. Self: The narrator has a battle with his conscience at the end, and has the old man's heartbeat haunting him.</p>

            <div class="carousel-caption">
              <h3>Theme</h3>
              <p>There are two main themes of The Tell-Tale Heart. One common theme which correlates with the conflict of Person vs. Person is guilt. To prove this is a common theme, at the end of the story, the narrator has some regret of killing the old man because the sounds of the hearbeat is engraved in his mind. Another theme is madness, which correlates with the conflict of Person vs. Self. During the story, the narrator keeps claiming that he is not a madman despite killing the old man because of his eye, and  the author may have added this in the story to emphasize the point that the narrator does not know what he is doing wrong.</p>

              <h3>Verbal Irony</h3>
              <p>Irony is a huge part of this story, which correlates with the second theme of madness and the conflict of Person vs. Self. The narrator repeatedly says in the story that he is not a madman; he devises a plan to kill the old man. However, the narrator obviously is a madman, because he has the audacity to kill an old man just because of fear of his eye. Moreover, it's likely that the narrator believes that what he did was okay, not knowing how pyschopathic he is -- so he definitely needs help.</p>

            <div class="carousel-caption">
              <h3>Characterization</h3>
              <p>The narrator is probably the most terrifying person in the story, and he himself describes himself as ill, but not a madman. He is very much both, and the narrator emphasizes each point to show how he is the victim and vigilante. He is haunted by the old man's heartbeat at the end, and has lots of guilt. Then, the old man is described as a person who didn't do anything wrong, but that the narrator only killed him for his eye, which was "one of a vulture". Next, the policemen are not described that much; only that they believed the narrator when he was lying about where the old an's cry was coming from. Lastly, there is a brief mention of a neighbor which is barely described, and is only said to report the old man's cry as he was getting killed.</p>

            <div class="carousel-caption">
              <h3>An Example of Imagery</h3>
              <p>There is lots of descriptive language in The Tell-Tale Heart. Here is a piece when the narrator is at the old man's home to kill the old man: Now I could hear a quick, low, soft sound, like the sound of a clock heard through a wall. It was the beating of the old man's heart. I tried to stand quietly. But the sound grew louder. The old man's fear must have been great indeed. And as the sound grew louder my anger became greater and more painful. But it was more than anger. In the quiet night, in the dark silence of the bedroom my anger became fear — for the heart was beating so loudly that I was sure some one must hear. I decided to choose this piece from The Tell-Tale Heart because it shows the fear of the old man and the narrator. The old man is terrified as the narrator approaches to kill him, and the narrator is terrified that his plans would be ruined because some one else would hear the heartbeat. The narrator is also angry; he was in such an urge to murder the old man and that this was the time. The heartbeat and the feelings of the two are scrutinized well in this part, so I chose theis part from the story to show how the heartbeat terrified and angered the narrator, and would also haunt him.</p>
